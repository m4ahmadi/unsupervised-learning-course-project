# unsupervised-learning-course-project
## [course project 2](http://ce.sharif.edu/courses/94-95/1/ce717-2/index.php/section/assignments/file/assignments)

In the first phase of the project, clustering techniques (k-means, EM Bernoulli, EM Multinomial) were evaluated on the MINST dataset.

In part two, PCA feature reduction technique is investigated on '20 news groups' dataset.

Both of these parts are implemented using scikit-learn library in Python.
